# WeatherApp
 This is a weather app created using Python and a graphical user interface (GUI) library. The app allows users to enter a location and view the current weather conditions for that location, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description of the weather.

## Installation
To use this app, you will need to have Python installed on your computer, as well as the following Python libraries:
Tkinter
requests

You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command in your terminal:
`pip install tkinter requests`

## Usage
To use the app, run the weather_app.py file in your Python environment. This will open up the app's graphical user interface, where you can enter a location in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button to view the current weather conditions for that location.

The app uses the `OpenWeatherMap` API to retrieve weather data, so you will need to have an API key in order to use it. You can sign up for a free API key on the [OpenWeatherMap ](https://openweathermap.org/)website.
