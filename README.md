# WeatherApp
 Weather App This is a weather app created using Python and a graphical user interface (GUI) library. The app allows users to enter a location and view the current weather conditions for that location, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description of the weather.

## Installation
To use this app, you will need to have Python installed on your computer, as well as the following Python libraries:
Tkinter
requests

You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command in your terminal:
`pip install tkinter requests`

## Usage
To use the app, run the weather_app.py file in your Python environment. This will open up the app's graphical user interface, where you can enter a location in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button to view the current weather conditions for that location.

The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data, so you will need to have an API key in order to use it. You can sign up for a free API key on the OpenWeatherMap website.

Once you have an API key, open the weather_app.py file in a text editor and replace the value of the api_key variable with your own API key:
`api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`
Save the file and run it again to use the app with your API key.
